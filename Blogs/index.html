                Muhammad Asaduzzaman, a doctor treating Covid-19 patients, has nightmares that people are gasping for
                air
                and
                pleading to be saved.</p>

            <blockquote>

                "When someone touches your hand, begs for help to breathe and when that person dies before you, it's
                very
                difficult to keep your calm. It's extremely hard to sleep at night peacefully. It comes back to
                haunt
                you,"
                he says.

                An assistant professor and head of the department of critical care at the capital's Kuwait Bangladesh
                Friendship Hospital, the 42-year-old doctor has been providing care to coronavirus patients for a year
                now.
                But over the last few weeks, the conditions of many critical patients have deteriorated fast, leaving
                physicians like Asaduzzaman absolutely hapless.

                "I am tired of seeing people die. I could not do anything [in many cases] … I feel like I am on the
                verge of
                having a psychological breakdown," he told The Daily star.

                Apart from claiming the lives of many doctors and health workers, the Covid-19 is also taking a heavy
                toll
                on their mental health.
